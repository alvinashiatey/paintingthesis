    "bio": "The work is an ode to the awe-inspiring biological force of compostable, ephemeral subjects such as leaves, decaying fruit, branches, iron metals, and plant matter. I consider how paint, photographic emulsion, and material assemblage come together as a metaphor for the first compost or primordial soup: a prebiotic mixture of organic matter that is the hypothetical origin of all life on earth. I use paint and emulsion as an  impermanent substance that composes, conjoins, coagulates, and decomposes images. I often bathe the surface of my canvases in thinned paint that is dispersed on top of water. The resulting paint-washed surfaces appear veiny, amorphous, foggy, rusty, and covered with mold—all aesthetic conditions that conjoin figure and ground to suggest a oneness of material form that emerges from the primordial soup. The work’s in-between-states quality in all media encourages an active way of portraying the  subjects, which are integral things like nutrient rich-rotten plant matter or polluted air.  I enjoy mixing categories of subject and content to offer a nuanced way to reconsider the  “overlooked,” traditionally regarded as unimportant material beings that have complex relationships with our ecologies. //n &emsp; I often paint from observation as a way to form a durational, embodied experience with  subjects across time. I consider the act of painting from observation a form of agency to meditate on my body by mingling with other bodies in a culture that is usually distracted from the physical and spiritual realms. Photography coincides with my painting practice and offers a field-based research way of working that records moments at the intersection of my perception, the subject, and the camera.  Instant photography emphasizes the space between articulate form and particulate matter by an atmospheric blurring quality produced by the dynamics of environmental light, potassium chemicals and dye layers within the film. I see this dynamic as yet another aesthetic stand-in for the prebiotic soup or ultimate realm of possibility.  I think it is important to ponder the relationships of various ways of making an image in order to get at the heart of what it means to reflect on the world through media.",

Given that his family has oscillated between two countries for over a century, his work centers on the beauty of tacit and intergenerational embodied knowledge that thrives within migrant communities. As a trained printmaker, he relies on a mixed media format that explores materials used by laborers. In this way, he communes with his family's migrant legacy, and he celebrates the knowledge of a family that was never formally educated. More importantly, he reasserts their histories in the face of a traditional Western canon that has upheld exploitative neoliberal power structures. By doing so, he attempts to grant space to migrant communities that continue to reinvent themselves despite xenophobic persecution and condemnation.",

Unstable, incomplete utterances amplify the search for any evidence that can metabolize abstract phenomena into concrete concepts. In my experience with hearing loss, I find that searching for this evidence induces a state of heightened awareness, urgent listening. //n &emsp; Paintings are utterances; particulate gestures constitute fields of chromatic data. In my work, the patterned map promises legibility as fixed parameters complete themselves. Through the generation of random events, the relentless, orderly hum dissolves into chaos, into ecstatic language. //n &emsp; Unwieldy systems bear witness to the fraying of meaning, setting up a mind game wherein all things are inherently untethered. In the building and breaking of legibility, the observer is drawn into a state of questioning, a listening vision of the moments in miscommunication when words become sounds, and when sounds become words.",

    "bio": "In 1718, Mr. Elihu Yale, a former governor of Madras under the East India Company, sent a gift to a struggling school in Connecticut in order to establish Yale College. This donation, consisting of books, a painting, and “goods,” was the largest the University would receive for over a century. The 300+ volumes sent by Mr. Yale can still be accessed in the Yale University Library today, while the painting of King George I of Great Britain and Ireland has been carefully conserved by the Yale University Art Gallery. //n &emsp; Despite being the most valuable component of the donation, scarce records were made or maintained of the “goods.” The records that do survive clearly indicate that they consisted specifically of 1 case of soy sauce, 2 jars of mango chutney, 1 jar of nutmeg, and 3 bales of various textiles handwoven by weavers in India. A majority of theses items were sold in the port of Boston by 1721, likely to slave traders who went on to exchange them for captives in West Africa. The money from their sale was used to secure the future of Yale University. //n &emsp; This body of work attempts to recreate the donation that founded this University, with a particular focus on the parts of the gift that have not been discussed, studied, or preserved. The process included extensive archival research, historical contextualization, masturbation in the library, and re-weaving, by hand, the various types of cloth which formed the bulk of Mr. Yale’s gift.",

    "bio": "The looping metals, strung chili peppers, encapsulated sugar, and woven organza in my work are analogous to language. A language in which ephemeral ingredients entangle with everyday industrial materials creating throughlines of impermanence across spatiotemporal locales. I collect foods, like corn husks, avocado pits, and orange peels, in its various states of decomposition from family, friends, and shared meals. These materials become sculptural weavings and incarnate objects, spaces, and moments. //n &emsp; Honoring these relationships through materials and exchange while interrogating the complexities and intimacies between and within Asia and Americas, I form connections that are synonymous with migration and people’s relationships with home, foodways, and their everyday environments. I am interested in problematizing intersecting forms of lineage, sociality, and political economy that have shaped the collectivites and imaginaries of the dispossessed by drawing from cultural, familial, spiritual, and ecological histories, both chosen and inherited. //n &emsp; My art practice is rooted in playing with materials and repetitive mark-making to build up patterns and surfaces that offer new possibilities of existing beyond our struggles and cultural representations in discursive and metaphysical realms. These metaphorical gestures are deeply connected to my Chinese-Guatemalan roots and Miami upbringing, while considering the trans-continental kinship networks of my community.",

The basis of my work is a symbolic lexicon I have derived from social politics, art history, and pop-culture. I explore cognitive dissonance theory, love-based philosophies, and theories of social-group identity. At an intersection of these theoretical points of departure, I excavate personal narratives of toxic masculinity and male violence glimpsed through a queer, sex-worker lens. Through painting, writing, and multimedia responses, I reflect on historical violence in the context of masculine identities in a Western framework and encapsulate such identities in exploration of  imagination and romance, capitalism, and autobiographical narratives; ultimately arriving at the unbearable contradictions that we, nevertheless, struggle to bear concerning encounters with others, ourselves, and the world. I generate dynamic and uncanny figurative compositions populated with comic relief, erotica, pornography, contemporary politics, and references to contemporary queer culture. These manifest in paintings, books of poetry, novels, and as of late, marble sculpture.",

The site of this exploration is my studio, which is a space that holds itself together by this trust and occupies ground at the edge of standard western biopolitical structures—the systematic administration of lives. This distant occupation doesn’t remove my studio from these structures. This is impossible. Rather, the distance allows space that helps provide an intention of trust towards myself and my practice. //n &emsp; This trust promotes a mindfulness to which I have to prepare a full criticality of everything, including that of myself. Through this, I then feel comfortable enough to give myself permission to analyze the trauma and divisiveness Western biopolitical structures can produce in lives; most notably the trauma it has created within myself after nearly a decade of incarceration, and the alienation formed in past generations of immigrant auto workers in my family. //n &emsp; Western biopolitical boundaries are often drawn by many structures, most notably class, law, race, and gender. My practice explores the administration of these structures. This administration of lives produces standard formalities that generations of peoples embody. //n &emsp; Within my practice, I choose to mimic this embodiment through selective material manipulation, and to produce structural forms of my own to hold and carry these embodied materials. In formality, this approach mimics biopolitical administration, and allows me an opportunity to explore the prevailing western idea of livelihood. Alienation is a leveraging of lives, which doesn’t permit space for one to feel authentic moments of self realization. This is the violence in the administration of societies. My studio and I reject alienation. As I explore, create, destroy, and embody, my life is my own dedication, and my practice belongs to no one but myself.",

On a fundamental level, all that we see is shaped by the physics of light and the intricacies of our perception.\nI am a nonbinary trans-feminine artist working with the materials and histories of photography, printmaking, and representational drawing and painting. Through devotional acts of image and object making, I question the rigid and violent organizing principles that structure our public and private lives—and hold sacred the complexity of embodiment, intimacy, and identity construction.\nI have created room-size installations exploring the bathtub as a metaphor for the body; made large-scale kallitypes using the mechanics of light to reveal the fluidity of a figure in space; and combined mechanical drawing, photo processes, and oil painting to capture the delicacy of healing. I view process, materiality, and embodied knowledge as essential research in my practice. I am driven by my compulsion to seek out the ghost of the making in all things that are made—and my desire to share the revelations I find in these encounters.",

    "bio": "The archive has nothing to tell me, but I am listening anyway. Aboard the Robert Browne, a Connecticut ship, four hundred Chinese men revolted. Duped by promises of being brought to California, they fought to prevent their certain deaths in the guano mines of Peru. The story bears the indelible marks of archival violence: the only names and identities that remain are those of their white captors. Through what ethics could I reanimate the dignity of those who, according to history as written, do not exist? //n &emsp; My solution foregrounds embodiment. In this installation, I adopt the formats of the nineteenth century American cyclorama and the Chinese handscroll painting to create a walk-in narrative container for the experiences of the men aboard the Robert Browne. In this theater of redacted history, men dream of greener shores, fight, and capitulate. They retch at the smell of their own filthy bodies, plot by candlelight, and tend to one another after desperation compels them to the ultimate violence. Each of the hundreds of figures in the work is a pose I took, a face I grimaced, a scenario I inhabited with physical commitment, however momentarily. Through this act of self-investment, I contend with Saidiya Hartman’s call to “exceed or negotiate the constitutive limits of the archive.” As I listen to the archive’s silence, I tell as much of the story as I am capable of bearing.",

Through painting and sculpture, I consider the built environment as a departure point to unfold material narratives. //n &emsp; My process starts by taking a walk outside and using a handheld digital scanner to capture the gestures and marks embedded in walls, streets, and light poles. I carefully translate these images into my works through a spectrum of machined tolerances and loosely devised matrices. By reverse painting atop slick industrial substrates, I build up countless layers of coagulated pigment through vectorized sequences into pliable membranes of paint that I reinforce with burlap and peel off. I consider my process a proposition for perception; tracing the interdependent realities of machines, coded biological organisms, and extensions of ourselves.

    "bio": "Samantha Joy Groff is a multidisciplinary artist from rural Pennsylvania who was raised in a small Mennonite community. Her painting practice pits the history and conservative values of the Pennsylvania Dutch against the contemporary ideals of wealth and sexuality through the female experience. These contradictory ideas perform in a space plagued with isolation and Appalachian fatalism where the body is bent in unnatural ways to fit the picture plane's impossibly tight composition. Personal narrative is utilized to ground the work and mythologize the female figure through allegory and animal symbols. In an attempt to capture the duality of hard living and the aspiration for class mobility, the work features a window to rural subjects that are both human and non-human. Animals, plants, and humans enmesh into a knot of competing desires fighting for the focal point. She is interested in exploring the commingling of bodies, affect, and color. Drawing on research of medieval Christian bestiaries, Groff paints the animal subjects that morph between bad taxidermy, folk art, and realistic rendering to achieve a fractured psyche of layered intimacies and hierarchies. She aims to compress the pastoral's infinite horizon, zooming into a claustrophobic close-up of dangerous emotions hiding just past or beneath the surface.",

    "bio": "I value an artwork becoming a secret ritual or an afterthought in daily life compared to the spectacle and formality of a public viewing experience. Observations from working in museums as a receptionist and in residential homes as a cleaner sculpted this belief and the interplay of private and public in my practice. //n &emsp; At times, the audience’s role is redefined as a wearer or maker, and they have agency over the direction of the work as it follows them throughout the day. Within the co-authorship structure, I enjoy not knowing the totality of the work and facilitating an inward experience for others. //n &emsp; For my project Buried Museum, I buried and unearthed a time capsule in my backyard containing artworks addressed to the future selves of the participants. In 2021, I attempted to return each work to its owner and documented the process in an artist book. Letter Writing Station also asked visitors to write a message to their future self, which will be returned at an upcoming date. //n &emsp; My background in reiki, a healing practice involving gentle touch, led me to consider textiles in contact with the body as a healing source, too. Through touch, an exchange occurs between person and object, and a wearer’s imprint remains on the fabric. //n &emsp; Dream Sheets is an embroidered dream journal on my own bed sheets, and Routine’s Dispersed Light is an outfit with a stitched map on the inner seam worn by friends and myself. The videos that are playing on cellphones document the fleeting works through Instagram stories, cat videos, and stop-motion animations. I explore if text messages are poems and if personal devices are an extension of one’s body. When exhibited, my projects become ephemeral installations comprising readily available materials composed with care and humor.",

    "bio": "Referencing architectural phenomena, historical narratives, and semiotics, I create textiles, objects, paintings, and prints. Using an interdisciplinary process, I create spatial and bodily poetry to engage my interests in record-keeping and the \"life of objects.\" Who is permitted authorship and what survives or is preserved is a historical question I have about power. I believe old, defunct, or obsolete technologies can illuminate our present conditions. //n &emsp; I reflect on speed as a material related to the human condition, and why the field of sociology emerged in response to the Industrial Revolution. I gravitate towards themes of movement, migration, circulation, expansion, mechanization, colonization and the psychological impact of these various social conditions. I view language and religion as records within these phenomena. //n &emsp; My weavings engage my interest in pre-industrial processes and material culture through their site-specific surfaces. The text in my work is typically found from locations like the archive or architectural monuments. The silk organza and leno-woven surfaces invoke transparency and opacity as various metaphors. The transformation of language over time is of interest in my recent work. I have been researching religious texts from the Philippines. Tagalog is a language my mom speaks, and it is riddled with English and Spanish. //n &emsp; My plaster casts are the inverse of my weavings, and indicate the body as present through the bulbous surfaces that fabric records. My woodcut prints reference fingerprints and spider web environments and question the archives of invention. At times, my armatures appropriate historical objects – for example a pre-industrial spinning wheel or a room divider. My guiding forces are textile history, concrete poetry, mechanization, and the body related to speed and therefore weaving, printmaking, typography have become naturally occurring features of my process.",

    "bio": "The matter between our ears pulses with neural electricity, charged by excitations of color and shadow. Visual experience is localized in our cognition- color is registered in one location, line and depth in another. I directly stimulate these processing regions of the brain. I build paintings from back to front in a process of strict accounting: I mix gradients in sequences of varying hue, value, and saturation. I then apply tape and masking fluid to canvas to create networks of thin stripes that intersect at slanting angles. The color-modulated lines weave together and produce animated patterns that simultaneously recall cabaret curtains, a stovetop flame, and the spectral vibrancy of the aurora borealis. //n &emsp; These paintings flicker between the theatrical and the organic: they direct focus to individual moments of color immersed in a system that resembles camouflage. This duality is a magic trick; looking closely, you see fine intersecting lines that create narrow diamonds of hue. Step back, and the composition coalesces into a spread of sensations that is fixed, fluid and warped. My paintings are windows of uncanny atmosphere, a glimpse of churning chroma and interference pattern. //n &emsp; I paint because visual sensation is psychophysical- it transforms our thoughts. The tension that links granular color experience and optical illusion generates questions about self-understanding. Our minds alone are the site of ecstasy and suffering, a lesson I internalized while working as an overnight operator on a suicide hotline. Coping with trauma, panic, and dissociation is a matter of proximity to the event. The way we decode percepts— received environmental data about what is happening— is a high stakes affair. Each move in my paintings is tightly controlled. when the final mask is taken off, however, the particular consequence of each decision is striking and unforeseen. This mystery compels me. Science, politics and technology recount an ever-narrowing view of what it means to be human, pulling our attention from one algorithmically engineered solution to the next. My paintings lure the eye into new, uncertain spaces.",

    "bio": "athena quispe is a Peruvian-American multidisciplinary artist and romantic poet dedicated to the cosmic endeavor of softening and distorting symbolic ideas and materials to create poetic installations and synesthetic environments that increase psychic and soul redemption. For example, she installs green filters to radicalize the institutional setting, creating a magenta afterimage to alter cognitive processes that soothe the eye and our emotions. Furthermore, she distills scents to create incense, works with natural pigments, ancestral human blood, metallurgy, pyrography, fire, printmaking, and pulverizes healing crystals to summon a power that mends the spiritual imbalance between humans and the objects of art and art-making. athena uses long-established academic painting strategies formalized throughout Europe in order to address questions and issues around decentering the canon of Western Art history and painting.

    "bio": "How can a painting practice grapple with the Anthropocene? Many artists speculate on fictional futures, creating sci-fi horizons composed of crumbling buildings and flooded plains. I instead look at the ground beneath our feet. The soot, the soil, the concrete, and the stone bear witness to our actions in the here and now. My paintings echo the substrates of our collective footprint; resembling fossilized slabs that crackle with clairvoyance of the future by speaking in the weathered voice of the past. //n &emsp; As a child, I used to spend hours each day searching for fossils in the prairie behind my childhood home. The process of wandering aimlessly and digging endlessly\u2013hoping to discover some fragment of fossilized life\u2013was a youthful obsession. Through the years, my experience with illness and loss have transformed this childhood interest into an art practice that examines the vast temporality of geologic time in relation to our own mortality. //n &emsp; My work registers the poetics of time through a process of additive and subtractive mark making. Layers of oil paint are added to the surface, left to dry, and then excavated; creating a geological sedimentation of pigment on the substrate. The paintings become visceral records of their own creation, resulting in topographical terrains that expose the traces of their own history. My practice thus becomes an act of excavation where past and present converge; an act of transmutation where duration and entropy become a way to understand the turbulent tectonics of the body and the earth.",

    "bio": "Growing up along the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Lake Providence, Louisiana has led me to draw inspiration from the batture, the fluctuating space of loose clay, silt, sand, or gravel between the low-tide of the Mississippi River and the levee. For me, this fluctuating liminal space represents the plasticity of our environment as well as a complicated relationship between humanity and nature. My work features photos of levees and other water management structures to begin to imagine a world in the batture and open up space for imaging new possibilities for living with nature in the future. //n &emsp; I choose images from my archive of original photographs and family photo albums to sew compositions of snapshots that traverse time and space. I reveal the tactility and physicality of the photos by backing them with fabric batting and letting them hang so their edges bend and curl. I crop photographs by drawing with my sewing machine using a variety of stitches that both fortify and decorate the object. The repetition of the stitch and the irregularity of the edges of the collages create both rhythm and interference, like a DJ scratching a record. //n &emsp; My installations are multisensory experiences that feature sound sculptures. These objects are embedded with speakers that play a combination of original recordings, found sounds, and music. I use sounds that connect to the body and stimulate memory. I am invested in using these relationships to sound and music as a catalyst for changing perceptions of the built environment.",
