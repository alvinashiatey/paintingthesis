Given that his family has oscillated between two countries for over a century, his work centers on the beauty of tacit and intergenerational embodied knowledge that thrives within migrant communities. As a trained printmaker, he relies on a mixed media format that explores materials used by laborers. In this way, he communes with his family's migrant legacy, and he celebrates the knowledge of a family that was never formally educated. More importantly, he reasserts their histories in the face of a traditional Western canon that has upheld exploitative neoliberal power structures. By doing so, he attempts to grant space to migrant communities that continue to reinvent themselves despite xenophobic persecution and condemnation.",

The items can be more specifically described as textiles.  A close investigation of the varieties of textile, including muslin and calico, reveals that a majority of the cloth was undoubtedly made in the Indian subcontinent. In other documents, additional items sent by Mr. Yale to the Collegiate School are listed as: //n &emsp;31 pieces of Madras chintz //n &emsp;2 pieces of choice cloth flowered with silver //n &emsp;1 piece of rich satin with gold flowers //n &emsp;13 pairs of large gingham sheets //n &emsp;2 jars of mango chutney //n &emsp;1 case of soy sauce //n &emsp;1 jar of nutmeggs //n &emsp;Although not exclusively, as in the first list, this partial inventory is dominated by textiles. Furthermore, the non-textile items mentioned here immediately establish a strong case for the \u2018oriental\u2019 origins of Mr. Yale\u2019s goods. //n &emsp;Records show that by 1721 all the cloth sent by Elihu Yale had been sold in Boston, and that the money collected from those sales exceeds the value of any other single donation given to the college for the next century. Thus, it can perhaps be said that it was cloth, handwoven by Indian weavers, that secured the transformation of a small school in Connecticut with a tenuous future into the invincibly solvent Yale University as we know it today.",

At an intersection of these theoretical points of departure, I excavate personal narratives of toxic masculinity and male violence glimpsed through a queer, sex-worker lens. Through painting, writing, and multi-media respondence, I reflect on historical violence in the context of the cis-male, and specifically white cis-male, masculine identities in a Western framework, imagination and romance, capitalism, and autobiographical narratives. I generate dynamic and uncanny figurative compositions populated with comic relief, erotica, pornography, contemporary politics, and references to contemporary queer culture.

In a history book, I find passing reference to a revolt in which four hundred Chinese men, duped by promises of being brought to California, fought to prevent their certain deaths in the guano mines of Peru. The story bears the indelible marks of archival violence: the only names and identities that remain are those of white captors. Through what ethics could I reanimate the dignity of those who, according to history as written, do not exist? My solution is at once autobiographical, objective, and speculative, weaving together personal history, historical documents, and researched fictions. Through large scale landscape paintings and pseudo-museological objects of my own making, I immerse the viewer in a rehearsal of redacted history. I collage paintings, drawings, small sculptures, and writing onto or in proximity of a “main” painting or drawing, allowing narratives to play out in physically superimposed timelines. A keepsake box contains the portrait of an imagined loved one. Speech bubbles contain words uttered by American statesmen in favor of Chinese Exclusion. My brother and I make appearances as characters central to a rebellion. An impossible advertisement simultaneously offers the solution to gardening woes and the “Asiatic problem.” These “footnotes” intervene historically and materially on conventions of representation in Western history painting and Chinese scroll painting. Inverting the relationship between “text” and “footnote,” I foreground the constructed nature of historical narratives. Heeding Saidiya Hartman\u2019s call to “jeopardize the status of the event,” I listen to the archive\u2019s silence and critically fabulate from there.",

Her painting practice pits the history and conservative values of the Pennsylvania Dutch against the contemporary ideals of wealth and sexuality through the female experience. These contradictory ideas perform in a space plagued with isolation and Appalachian fatalism where the body is bent in unnatural ways to fit the picture plane's impossibly tight composition. Personal narrative is utilized to ground the work and mythologize the female figure through allegory and animal symbols. In an attempt to capture the duality of hard living and the aspiration for class mobility, the work features a window to rural subjects that are both human and non-human. Animals, plants, and humans enmesh into a knot of competing desires fighting for the focal point. She is interested in exploring the commingling of bodies, affect, and color. Drawing on research of medieval Christian bestiaries, Groff paints the animal subjects that morph between bad taxidermy, folk art, and realistic rendering to achieve a fractured psyche of layered intimacies and hierarchies. She aims to compress the pastoral's infinite horizon, zooming into a claustrophobic close-up of dangerous emotions hiding just past or beneath the surface.",

For example, the earliest known use of the term “embroidery” was by poet John Gower, describing his wife\u2019s daily activities in 1393. I have come to understand the supports in my work to analyze the household as a lens onto larger historical narratives.",

    "bio": "The matter between our ears pulses with neural electricity, charged by excitations of color and shadow. Visual experience is localized in our cognition: color is registered in one location, line and depth in another. I directly stimulate these processing regions of the brain. I build paintings from back to front in a process of strict accounting: I mix gradients in sequences of varying hue, value, and saturation. I then apply tape and masking fluid to canvas to create networks of thin stripes that intersect at slanting angles. The color-modulated lines weave together and produce animated patterns that simultaneously recall cabaret curtains, a stovetop flame, and the spectral vibrancy of the aurora borealis. My paintings are windows of uncanny atmosphere, a glimpse of churning chroma and interference pattern.",

She distills scents and works with natural pigments, metallurgy, pyrography, printmaking, and pulverizes healing crystals to summon a power that mends the spiritual imbalance between humans and the objects of art and art-making.  She uses long-established academic painting strategies formalized throughout Europe in order to address questions and issues around decentering the canon of Western Art history and painting. Her art and creative style is a continuation and transmutation of her Andean heritage and that of the autochthonous \u2018Americas\u2019—a precolonial imagination and invention often and wrongly accredited to European innovations.",

    "bio": "How can a painting practice grapple with the Anthropocene? Many artists speculate on fictional futures, creating sci-fi horizons composed of crumbling buildings and flooded plains. I instead look at the ground beneath our feet. The soot, the soil, the concrete, and the stone bear witness to our actions in the here and now. My paintings echo the substrates of our collective footprint; resembling fossilized slabs that crackle with clairvoyance of the future by speaking in the weathered voice of the past. //n As a child, I used to spend hours each day searching for fossils in the prairie behind my childhood home. The process of wandering aimlessly and digging endlessly\u2013hoping to discover some fragment of fossilized life\u2013was a youthful obsession. Through the years, my experience with illness and loss have transformed this childhood interest into an art practice that examines the vast temporality of geologic time in relation to our own mortality. //n My work registers the poetics of time through a process of additive and subtractive mark making. Layers of oil paint are added to the surface, left to dry, and then excavated; creating a geological sedimentation of pigment on the substrate. The paintings become visceral records of their own creation, resulting in topographical terrains that expose the traces of their own history. Painting thus becomes an excavation site where past and present converge; an act of transmutation where duration and entropy become a way to understand the turbulent tectonics of the body and the earth.",

    "bio": "My installations draw inspiration from the batture, the fluctuating space of loose clay, silt, sand, or gravel between the low-tide of the Mississippi River and the levee. Within my work, I emulate this dynamic space by considering how the art and architecture support a flow of ideas and imagination. I use music, repetition, light and scale to adjust the tone of the space. These shifts change the audience's relationship to everything they see, blurring the line between audience and artwork. //n I approach painting, sculpture, and video through collage. The elements that make up the pieces of my collage are fractured and broken wood, paper, and photographs. I use the pieces to create shapes of color and texture that vibrate between image and abstraction. Joints become abstract repetitive patterns that both fortify and decorate the object. These edges produce rhythm and interference, like a record scratch. The new textured surface is a mosaic of memories; the parts create a complete story while retaining their individuality. //n For me, collage is a visual representation of the relationship between space and time. I use the elemental parts of my images; color, texture, and material to explore the limits of recognition. This stretching and compressing of information creates visual and auditory noise that hopefully opens up space for imaging new possibilities for living with nature in the future.",
